<h3> A complete framework designed to develop desktop ERP solutions. </h3>

ERP Studio.net was born about 11 years ago with the .net Framework 2.0 to test the features offered by linking datasets with databases and binding with the controls.

Today the framework has a complete integration with the SqlServer, Sqlcompact and Sqllite relational databases with automatic database creation management and a fluent method for creating queries.
It's integrates a reporting system through Crystal Report.

ERP Studio.net implements multi-language forms, multi-user management with optimistic lock control, and a complete system of protection and update.

Since 2016 ERP Studio.net uses and expands the [Metro framework](http://denricdenise.info/2014/09/winforms-metro-style/) of Denis Magno to have a more modern look and feel.
